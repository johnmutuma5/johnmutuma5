### Hi there 👋 

Welcome to my profile!! 👯 😄 😄 . Feel free to explore stuff here. If you're enthused by **_Vim_** and **_tmux*_**, you might learn something on [this repository](https://github.com/johnmutuma5/vim-editor).

I am based in Nairobi, Kenya, where I live with my spouse and 2 lovely daughters 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧

- 🔭    I’m currently working on People Experiences across M365 Microsoft web and mobile products
- 🌱    I’m currently learning native mobile apps development
- 🤔    I’m looking for help with how to learn the guitar quickly
- 📫    How to reach me: johnmutuma5@gmail.com
- ⚡     Fun fact: I have been lost a lot while trying to find myself:
  -   _I skipped my 2nd and half of 3rd years in high school, and went to be pool/billiard table attendant_
  -   _Worked as a banker for 4 years before realizing that software engineering is my right place._ 👨🏽‍💻 
- 💬    Chat with me about fatherhood, roadtrips _(cars, motorbikes, etc.)_, growing succulents _(disclaimer)_, spiritual scripture
- 😄    Pronouns: He/Him/His
